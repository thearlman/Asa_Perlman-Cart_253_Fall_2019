-Put in timer that counts down to when you have reached planet amazon
-Make game over screen graphics (maybe with bezos inside of another spaceship having caught up to you?)

  QUESTIONS:
  -Why is the game lagging so much?

  -Why do the phazers miss sometimes?

  -Try webgl createCanvas(windoWidth, windowHeight, WEBGL);
              allFunctionswithXandY(x, y, z); (DOES THIS REALLY NOT WORK WITH 2D SHAPE FUNCTIONS??)

  -Can't figure out the setInterval function
